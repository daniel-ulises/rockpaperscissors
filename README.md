# Simple **Rock Paper Scissors** game
Some time ago I was following the beginners guide from [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com) and one of the first Javascript projects I have finished was a simple rock paper scissors game. That was a few months back, so I decided to rewrite the code from scratch and give it a spin, see if I am able to write it differently. It is also a way for me to not get rusty on Javascript.

I am using [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com) to display the hands, I added some very basic animations and changed the layout a little bit. I have also decided to give **Sass** a try and have some fun with it while getting used to it.
